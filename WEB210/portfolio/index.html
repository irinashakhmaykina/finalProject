                    <p>Hello, my name is Irina Shakhmaykina and I am a web designer and developer hoping to get more into the industry. I was born in Russia and moved here when I was only 6 years old. I soon grew interested in everything computer related and took my first Python class at 11 years old. Since then I've been taking computer science classes in high school and at Wake Tech where I started getting more into web design. Now I continue to pursue my passion of coding and designing web pages while striving to complete high school. </p>
